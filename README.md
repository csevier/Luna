# Luna
This project used cmake. On linux this is easy as hell, simply run the dependency script:

./ubuntu_linux_deps.sh

Then use the root CMakeLists.txt file to configure your project.
Only caveat is at the moment texture and shader files and relatively found from build directory, so make sure your cmake build directory is at the root and youll be good.
